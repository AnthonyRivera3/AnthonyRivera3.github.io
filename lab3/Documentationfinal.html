            -Endpoints
            The API has a total of two endpoints. The two endpoints are from the historical data section. One 
            of them allows the user to fetch any information about the currency conversions from any day of 
            the year on any year. For example, it could show the currency in Japan today and from 1997 and 
            show the conversion rates between other countries for any day for the year. The second endpoint 
            for the historical data section is meant to return specific amounts of currency results. You put in 
            the exact amount of currency, and you get a result of what that is worth globally. For the 
            historical data sections parameters are USD, YEAR, MONTH, DAY, AMOUNT.

            -Extra Info: 
            It is important to understand what the currency exchange API can bring to the table 
            before you look at it. You might think that there isn’t much data being pulled with this 
            API. Although not much data is being pulled it is a very convenient API for a couple 
            reasons. It could help solve many questions people might think about when leaving 
            their home country to go on vacation or even to move. This could be extremely 
            helpful for those who like to plan trips ahead and make sure they have the right 
            amount of money to take with them (exchange). This API could be very useful on 
            historical sites for old data for students studying economics and just general 
            information. This API could be common for connecting to airport linked websites so it 
            could be convenient for people to check when booking a trip out of the country. The 
            API does have a key and requires a membership to access them if the free trial runs 
            out. Every month the requests refill from 30,000. Other than that, accessing the API 
            is self-explanatory
